# Spring Security Authentication and Authorization with JWT
## Project Description
This project aims to implement the concepts of Spring Security Authentication and Authorization using JWT (Json Web Token). The main goal of this project is to create a secure and robust authentication and authorization system that is easy to use and maintain. JWT provides a way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object, and this project utilizes it to enhance the security of the Spring Security system.

## Project Features
The project will include the following features:

- Secure authentication and authorization using JWT
- Custom user authentication and authorization with database integration
- Custom access control based on roles and permissions
- Password encryption and decryption for enhanced security
- Token-based authentication and authorization for stateless applications
- Spring Security configuration for enabling and disabling endpoints
- Comprehensive testing to ensure functionality and security

## Technologies
The project will utilize the following technologies:

- Java
- Spring Framework
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Token (JWT)
- PostgreSQL

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).
3. Configure the project to use PostgreSQL.
4. Run the project using the mvn spring-boot:run command.

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Send a POST request to the /api/v1/auth/authenticate endpoint with valid credentials to obtain a JWT token.
2. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header of all subsequent requests.
3. Access protected endpoints based on the user's role and permissions.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a secure and robust authentication and authorization system for Spring Security using JWT. With custom user authentication and authorization, role-based access control, and token-based authentication, this project provides a solid foundation for any application that requires secure user management.
